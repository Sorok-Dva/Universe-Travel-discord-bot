# U*Travel Helper Discord
__(readme in construction)__

_For the discord community U*Travel ([Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Evd7mgdMZ2))_
*U\*Travel Community* is a community base on astronomy and science. This bot will go in these purposes.

I will create some commands related to space, like getting live data from ISS, getting information about a celestial object,
or getting some cronjob that every day will go on NASA website to take the picture of the day.

There'll also have some mods commands like mute that works 100% without this missing discord rights hierarchy.
(The user will lose all this ranks and will be saved and have a muted one (that you need to configure for each channel/category))
So the user haves only one role, muted with restricted permission.
Then when you unmute him, he just got back his roles, and he's removed from mute role

## Setup

1. Install Docker
2. Install the dependencies with `docker-compose run bot npm i`
3. Copy `.env` from `.env-example` and fill in the credentials
